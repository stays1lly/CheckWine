# CheckWine - Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various parameters using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains several features such as acidity levels, sugar content, pH, alcohol percentage, etc., which are believed to influence the quality of wine. We employ the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to build the predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various attributes of wine, including both red and white varieties. It consists of 1599 samples with 12 features. The data was obtained from Kaggle, and it has been preprocessed to remove any missing values or inconsistencies.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wine-quality-prediction
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook wine_quality_prediction.ipynb:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook wine_quality_prediction.ipynb
5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Random Forest Classifier model, and evaluate its performance.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
We utilize the Seaborn library for data analysis and visualization purposes. The notebook includes various visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (wine quality).

## Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn. We train the Random Forest Classifier model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to compare performance.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters of the Random Forest Classifier for better results.
- Collect additional data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time predictions.
